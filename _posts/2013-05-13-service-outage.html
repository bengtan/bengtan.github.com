  There was a service outage due to a software problem with our DNS provider. Whilst ProsePoint Express and all users sites were online, there were unreachable on the Internet. The issue has since been resolved, and all services are now back to normal. We apologise for this interruption of service. Downtime was approximately 8 minutes.
