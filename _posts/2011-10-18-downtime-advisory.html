title: Downtime Advisory for Oct 20th 2011
---

<p>
ProsePoint Express will be temporarily offline on October 20th 2011 from 06:00am to 10:00am UTC (Greenwich Mean Time) for scheduled maintenance. During this event, the ProsePoint Express service will be unavailable. 
</p><p>
ProsePoint Express user sites will be available (but no changes or edits can be made) except for a 5 to 10 minute interval at the beginning. In this 5 to 10 minute window, ProsePoint Express user sites will be unavailable.<!--break-->
</p><p>
Whilst we expect the maintenance to take about an hour (and user sites to be unavailable for up to 10 minutes), we are allocating four hours in case of unexpected difficulties. 
</p><p>
We will be logging the progress of this event on the status page at <a href="http://status.prosepoint.net">http://status.prosepoint.net</a>. 
</p><p>
You do not need to take any action. Your ProsePoint Express site will remain the same before and after the maintenance window. 
</p><p>
Thank you.
