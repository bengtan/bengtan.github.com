title: Scheduled maintenance, Sept 26th 2011
---

<p>
ProsePoint Express will be temporarily offline on September 26th 2011 from 02:00am to 06:00am (Greenwich Mean Time) for routine scheduled maintenance. During this time, the ProsePoint Express service and all ProsePoint Express sites will be unavailable. 
</p><p>
Whilst we expect the maintenance to take about an hour, we are allocating four hours in case of unexpected difficulties. 
</p><p>
We will be logging the progress of this event on the status page at http://status.prosepoint.net. 
</p><p>
You do not need to take any action. Your ProsePoint Express site will remain the same before and after the maintenance window. 
</p><p>
Thank you. 
</p><p>
(Apologies for the short notice and any inconvenience caused. We are running into capacity constraints and need to add more capacity to ProsePoint Express.)
