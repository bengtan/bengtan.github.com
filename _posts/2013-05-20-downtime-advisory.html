title: Downtime Advisory for May 27th 2013
---

<p>
ProsePoint Express will be temporarily offline on May 27th 2013 from 02:00am to 06:00am UTC (Greenwich Mean Time) for scheduled maintenance. During this event, the ProsePoint Express service will be unavailable. ProsePoint Express user sites should be available (but no changes or edits can be made). 
</p><p>
Whilst we expect the maintenance to take about an hour, we are allocating four hours in case of unexpected difficulties. 
</p><p>
We will be logging the progress of this event on the status page at <a href="http://status.prosepoint.net">http://status.prosepoint.net</a>. 
</p><p>
You do not need to take any action. Your ProsePoint Express site will remain the same before and after the maintenance window. 
</p><p>
Thank you.
